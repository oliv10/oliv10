									Oliver graduated form Park Tudor School in 2019. While at Park Tudor, Oliver mainly focused his elective classes; orchestra, computer sciecne, and technical theatre.
									Oliver played the cello for 2-3 years before switching to string bass in 7th grade and played that until he graduated.
									Oliver's favorite classes were his comuter science classes and took every one the school offered, all the way to AP CS.
									He also enjoyed his theatre tech classes even though he was unable to take it as often as he had liked.
									During his senior year he applied to DePaul Universtiy as a Computer Science major but before classes began, during the incoming students tour, he asked if he could go look at The Theatre School that he had heard about.
									After touring the theatre school he decided that this is what he wanted to do instead of computer science.
									He switched majors to Sound Design before classes had even began.
									He will graduate from DePaul Universtiy in 2023 with a major in Sound Design and a minor in Network Technology.
